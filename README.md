# Memory-card-game
Implementation of a card memory game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS
This simple web-based game challenges your memory as you match pairs of cards.

# Setup
To start the game, follow these steps:
  1. Clone or download the repository.
  3. After saving the project, make sure you have 3 code files and an assets folder for the images in the memory game folder. 
  2. Make sure you saved all images and icons under the same folder (the default folder name in the code is assets).
  4. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
  5. Enter your name and choose the number of cards (between 2 and 60) you want to play with.
  6. Click the "Start Game" button.

## How to Play
* Once the game starts, you'll see a grid of face-down cards.
* Click on any card to flip it over and reveal the image.
* Click on a second card to find a match.
* If the two cards match, they will stay face up; otherwise, they will flip back down.
* Keep flipping cards and making matches to increase your score.
* The game is complete when all pairs are successfully matched.

## Features
* Customizable: Choose the number of cards to play with.
* Timer: Track your time to see how fast you can complete the game.
